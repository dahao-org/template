# Governance Extensions

This directory contains extensions to the core DAHAO governance framework.

## Files

- `local-rules.yaml` - Sub-DAHAO specific governance rules
- `voting-mechanisms.yaml` - Custom voting procedures
- `roles.yaml` - Additional roles and permissions

## Guidelines

1. Extensions must not conflict with core values
2. All extensions should be documented
3. Changes require Sub-DAHAO community approval
4. Must maintain compatibility with core framework
